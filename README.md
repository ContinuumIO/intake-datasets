# intake-datasets

This is a repo for collecting data resources for [Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io). These may take the form of catalog files (YAML) or directpries which can be built into conda packages. We would also like to collect references to other publicly-available Intake catalogs.

The intent here is, that users should raise issues for single or sets of public datasets that they think would make interesting cases for Intake. When making issues, please be as specific as you can about what the data are and how they may be accessed.

A reference few datasets can be seen in the [Intake repo](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/intake/tree/master/examples). These catalogs are included in the Intake package when installed, and can also be installed as conda packages from the [Intake channel](https://anaconda.org/intake/repo)
